  <h3>Clownspiration!</h3>
  <p>For this lab, I created the very basics of the site (index page), learned about how to push changes to git, and all those beautiful things. I spent some time finding and sketching inspiration for this site. I LOVE Pierrot, the french clown, and wanted to go for a french circus vibe. I found a poster of "Cirque D'Hiver" (translates to "Winter Circus"), a historical seasonal circus in Paris. Hence the logo and name for this site! I wanted a recurring Pierrot-style character that is just a cameo for me, so I designed a little clown logo with my face. All of this started because of that stupid picture of a clown at his desk on the home page. Sometimes I feel like that when I am doing web dev, so I'm dedicating this to him. Also, I wanted practice making a website with a cohesive vibe and aesthetic, and what better way to do so than by having a theme?</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    
    <div class="learning-section">
      <h3>CSS Layout Techniques</h3>
      <p>In this lab, I explored two powerful CSS layout systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexbox</strong> - Perfect for one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars</li>
        <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong> - Ideal for two-dimensional layouts like image galleries</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="learning-section">
      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>I learned how to make clownsites adapt to different clown car sizes using balloon animals. This ensures my mime act looks great on tightropes, trapezes, and rings of fire.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
     While making this site, I learned lots of new or perhaps interesting things. But I will begin with what I still don't know and want to learn.
      I am not sure I actually understand how to create a grid or a flexbox, and I think I need to try it myself instead of copy-pasting it, HOWEVER, this is a nice, easy introduction to the topic. I also don't understand when it's appropriate to use px, rem, or vw/vh. I understand that the latter 2 are relative sizes, and px are important to use when you have specific screen sizes (e.g. smartphone), but it seems like these are interchanged a lot. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As for what I DID learn: I learned how to add a logo as a home button, by simply adding a link to index.html followed by the img element within a div. Crazy! I think selector specificity is beginning to click as well. Not all the way there yet though. It felt like a breakthrough when I finally understood the media tag: the rules under that tag only specify what happens when the content reaches a specific width. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, I had a lot of fun designing and conceptualizing my clown themed website. I even made a clown gif! Next step: figure out how to create a loading screen, so I can implement the clown gif.

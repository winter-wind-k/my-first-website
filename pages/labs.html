    <h2>Clownspiration!</h2>
  <p>For this lab, I created the very basics of the site (index page), learned about how to push changes to git, and all those beautiful things. I spent some time finding and sketching inspiration for this site. I LOVE Pierrot, the french clown, and wanted to go for a french circus vibe. I found a poster of "Cirque D'Hiver" (translates to "Winter Circus"), a historical seasonal circus in Paris. Hence the logo and name for this site! I wanted a recurring Pierrot-style character that is just a cameo for me, so I designed a little clown logo with my face. All of this started because of that stupid picture of a clown at his desk on the home page. Sometimes I feel like that when I am doing web dev, so I'm dedicating this to him. Also, I wanted practice making a website with a cohesive vibe and aesthetic, and what better way to do so than by having a theme?</p>

      <h2>CSS Layout Techniques</h2>
      <p>In this lab, I explored two powerful CSS layout systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexbox</strong> - Perfect for one-dimensional layouts like tightrope walks</li>
        <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong> - Ideal for two-dimensional layouts like trampoline jumping</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <div class="learning-section">
      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
      <p>I learned how to make clownsites adapt to different clown car sizes using balloon animals. This ensures my mime act looks great on trapezes, russian swings, and rings of fire.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
    While making this site, I learned lots of new or perhaps interesting things. But I will begin with what I still don't know and want to learn.
      I am not sure I actually understand how to create a grid or a flexbox, and I think I need to try it myself instead of copy-pasting it, HOWEVER, this is a nice, easy introduction to the topic. I also don't understand when it's appropriate to use px, rem, or vw/vh. I understand that the latter 2 are relative sizes, and px are important to use when you have specific screen sizes (e.g. smartphone), but it seems like these are interchanged a lot. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As for what I DID learn: I learned how to add a logo as a home button, by simply adding a link to index.html followed by the img element within a div. Crazy! I think selector specificity is beginning to click as well. Not all the way there yet though. It felt like a breakthrough when I finally understood the media tag: the rules under that tag only specify what happens when the content reaches a specific width. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, I had a lot of fun designing and conceptualizing my clown themed website. I even made a clown gif! Next step: figure out how to create a loading screen, so I can implement the clown gif.

      <h2>Storyboard Comparison</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="learning-section">
      <p>I compared my storyboard with Grace's to see where we differed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grace had a fully written out list of instructions of what each button's action was; whereas I had just the button and the different state on the next thumbnail</li>
        <li>I used a legend to differentiate storyboard symbols</li>
        <li>I incorporated numbering sparsely, whereas Grace had numbering on each thumbnail</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I think Grace's storyboard was more complete and easier to understand. The only drawback of her strategy is the visual clutter, which may unintentionally confuse whoever the storyboard is handed off to. Otherwise I think it's swell! The only thing I would change about my storyboard is probably some more written/textual description, instead of just symbols.</p>
      </p>
      <br>
        <p>The previsualization process for non-linear media is the same as the visualization process for linear media for me specifically. With my ADHD superpowers, I can't think linearly anyways so I come up with a story in disparate chunks no matter what I do. Therefore, all media is non-linear to me, and therefore all previsualization is non-linear as well.</p>
